# Custom-Password-Generator-using-python

This program helps the user to generate **n** number of passwords with an option of customizing the header. As a part of future enhancement this can also be presented through various other UIs and can be stored in any destination file.

## Prerequisites

  1. Python (any version)
  2. Pycharm / Jupyter Notebook / any IDE which supports python
  3. Random and String Modules 


## Python

Python 3.10, released in October 2021, introduced several new features, optimizations, and improvements over the previous versions. 

Some notable changes in Python 3.10 include:

1. Pattern Matching: Python 3.10 introduced a new syntax for structural pattern matching. This feature allows developers to perform more complex and expressive matching operations on data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

2. Precise Types: The match statement in pattern matching allows for more precise type hints and typing information, improving code readability and maintainability.

3. Parenthesized Context Managers: Python 3.10 introduced the ability to use multiple context managers in a single with statement, making the code more concise and readable.

4. Parenthesized Yield Expressions: This feature allows the use of parentheses around the yield expression in generator functions, improving code clarity and making it consistent with other syntax in Python.

5. New Syntax Features: Python 3.10 includes various syntax improvements, such as the "match" statement, improved error messages, and more consistent use of colons.

6. Performance Improvements: Each Python release typically includes various optimizations, and Python 3.10 is no exception. While the exact nature of these improvements may vary, the goal is generally to enhance the execution speed and efficiency of Python code.

7. Deprecations and Removals: Python 3.10 deprecated or removed certain features that were considered obsolete or problematic. Developers are encouraged to update their code to use newer, more robust alternatives.


## Pycharm IDE

PyCharm is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for Python development. Developed by JetBrains, PyCharm provides a comprehensive set of tools for coding in Python, enabling developers to write, test, and debug their Python applications efficiently. Here's a short description of PyCharm:

Key Features:

Code Editor: PyCharm offers a feature-rich code editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart code navigation, making it easier for developers to write and understand Python code.

Code Assistance: Intelligent code assistance tools, such as code completion, quick fixes, and code inspections, help developers write clean and error-free code.

Project Navigation: PyCharm provides powerful project navigation capabilities, allowing developers to easily explore and navigate through their project's structure.

Integrated Debugger: The IDE includes a robust integrated debugger for Python, enabling developers to identify and fix issues in their code efficiently.

Testing Support: PyCharm supports various testing frameworks, making it easy for developers to write and run unit tests and analyze test results directly within the IDE.

Version Control Integration: Seamless integration with version control systems like Git, Mercurial, and others allows developers to manage source code changes and collaborate with team members effectively.

Django and Web Development Support: PyCharm includes tools tailored for Django development and offers support for web development, making it suitable for building Python web applications.

Database Tools: PyCharm comes with built-in database tools for managing and interacting with databases directly within the IDE.

Built-in Terminal: The integrated terminal allows developers to execute Python scripts and commands without leaving the IDE.

Code Refactoring: PyCharm provides a range of code refactoring options to help developers improve the structure of their code while maintaining functionality.

Plugin Ecosystem: The IDE supports a variety of plugins, allowing developers to extend its functionality and integrate with additional tools and frameworks.

## Random Module

The random module in Python provides functions for generating pseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random but are generated using deterministic algorithms. Despite being deterministic, these algorithms produce sequences of numbers that exhibit statistical randomness, making them suitable for various applications like simulations, games, and cryptography.

## String Module

The string module in Python provides a collection of string constants and classes. It includes predefined constants for letters, digits, and punctuation, as well as classes like Template for advanced string formatting. The module is often used for tasks related to string manipulation and formatting.
